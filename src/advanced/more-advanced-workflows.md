# More advanced workflows

One of the best parts about using a version control system is the ability to
share that code with other people. So far, we've been using jj entirely on our
own machine, but it's time to explore how we can interface with tools that let
us collaborate.

Here's what we're going to learn:

* Working on all your branches simultaneously
* A pull request workflow called "Stacked PRs"
* Workspaces that let you have multiple local checkouts
* Using `git` and `jj` at the same time with colocated repositories
