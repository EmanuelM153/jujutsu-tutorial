# Setting up a repository

First I made [a new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/steveklabnik/jujutsu-tutorial).

Then:

```console
$ jj git clone https://github.com/steveklabnik/jujutsu-tutorial
$ cd jujutsu-tutorial
$ code .
$ mdbook init
```

And then started writing this.

I could have also made a repository locally, done stuff, then eventually pushed
it up to GitHub, but you *still* have to make a repository on their website
anyway, so if I know I already am gonna do that, it's easier just to do things
this way.
